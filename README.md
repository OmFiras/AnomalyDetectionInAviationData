AnomalyDetectionInAviationData
==============================

This is a class Project done to partially satisfy the requirements for the course CSCI 5525 - Machine Learning @ UMN.

The idea of this project is to find out the anomalous flights using unsupervised learning algorithms like PCA / Clustering. 

The Correlation matrices of the features was reduced in space using EigenValue Decomposition (EVD). Since the features had heavy correlation â€“ we used Matrix similarity and divergence measures followed by clustering to find the anomalies.

Team-mates: Rohit Deshpande and Pranjul Yadav.
